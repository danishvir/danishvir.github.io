  <h3>1. C programming language was released in 1972.</h3>
  <p>Dennis Ritchie,Ken Thompson, and their team developed C programming language based on the earlier language BCPL(which stands for Basic Combined Programming Language.)The source code for Unix was also written soon after in C. This helped Unix to be spread
    easily onto other computers and became popular fairly swiftly.Brian Kernighan wrote the first C tutorial and had an important contribution to the development of Unix.C is used very widely to this day. Dennis Ritchie, the main man in developing C,
    died in 2011.</p>

  <h3>2. The first IBM computer to use semiconductor memory was introduced by IBM IN 1970.</h3>
  <p>IBM released their first ever computer to use semiconductors in 1970.It was called the System 370 Model 145 mainframe computer.Compared to a computer using core memory,the Model 145 could store the same amount of information as a computer with core
    memory, but took up 50% less space.</p>
  <h3>3. Pascal programming language is introduced.</h3>
  <p>The Pascal programming language was named after French inventor,mathematician, and physicist Blaise Pascal.The language was introduced by Professor Niklaus Wirth.Their purpose was to develop a language that was applicable to both commercial and scientific
    applications.It was based on the ALGOL 60, a member of the ALGOL computer languages family. Wirth helped to develop ALGOL 60 as well.</p>
  <h3>4. WordStar is created in 1978.</h3>
  <p>WordStar was a word processor application that was very popular among personal computers.In 1981, it also started to become bundled with the Osborne 1 computer.This caused it to have significant market share.Some people continued to use it even after
    Microsoft Word exceed it in number of sales.It was developed by Rob Barnaby and released in 1978.</p>
  <h3>5. VisiCalc is developed in 1979.</h3>
  <p>VisiCalc, developed by MBA candidate Dan Bricklin and programmer Bob Frankston,was the program that turned the personal computer into a business machine.VisiCalc was initially developed for Apple II. Aplle II's sales were boosted with VisiCalc. Soon
    after, the ercalcuation of spreadshhets was automated. This made the program even better, as user could ask "What if" question of their financial information.</p>
