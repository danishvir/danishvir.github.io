          <h1>Tottenham Hotspur crash out of UEFA Champions League</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>Tottenham Hotspur lost 4-3 on aggregate to Juventus as the latter club progressed to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals at Tottenham's expense. Tottenham went into the second leg with an away goals advantage, and it seemed as if Totteham
            would win, as Son Heung-Min's 39th miunute goal gave Tottenham the advantage. Although the home side played better than Juventus, Argentine stars Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain scored in the space of three minutes to send Tottenham spiralling
            out of the Champions League. The day was heartbreak for Tottenham fans- the loss was undeserved. Tottenham will have to wait another year.</p>

            <div>
              The Detroit Red Wing shad a disastrous second period and lost 4-0 to the Las Vegas Golden Knights. For Vegas, this means that they will remain in first place in the Pacific Division and remain in prime position to advance to the playoffs.However, this
              is bad news for Detroit, who would have hoped to win this goal, although their chances of advancing to the playoffs are hanging by a thread. Cody Eakin and Alex Tuch each scored two goals to win the game for the Golden Knights, with one
              of the goals coming in a Red Wings powerplay. The Detroit Red Wings have now lost 5 games in a row. They will surely hope to see a change in their fortune soon.</p>

          <h1>Toronto Raptors beat Houston Rockets 108-105</h1>
          <p>The Toronto Raptors defeated the Houston Rockets 108-105 to extend their win streak to eight straight games. Despite the Rockets' recent loss to the Raptors, they still sit in first place in the Wester Conference. The loss is very insignificant,
            however, as the Houston Rockets have already clinched a playoff berth. It was a very narrow loss for the Rockets, and although James Harden dropped 40 points it proved to be insufficent as the Houston Rockets ended a very long win streak,which
            first began on the 28th of January. The Rockets face the San Antonio Spurs on March 12.
